# animeopenings-android
Native android client for openings.moe! (http://nulldev.xyz/apps/)

Original 'openings.moe' by AniDev: https://github.com/AniDevTwitter/animeopenings

# Features
- Very basic subtitle support
- Playlist builder*
- Easter eggs*
- Background and screen-off play<sup>+</sup>
- All other features included in web version

<sub>* not in release version</sub><br>
<sub>+ broken in dev version</sub>

# Status
Dev version (version in repo) is currently almost a complete rewrite of the old app and is very buggy.
If you are actually going to use this, I recommend downloading the release version instead.

# TODO List
- Fix all bugs in new dev version
- Background playing with notification controls
- Better subtitle support
- Video caching
- Setup CI

# Download
The release version can be downloaded at: http://nulldev.xyz/apps/

I may setup a CI for building development version soon.
